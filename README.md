This is an android app that allows you to talk to yourself. This is inspired from the saying of being your own best friend. 
This can app can function as a diary, or as a tool to talk and treat yourself with love and care.

We often treat our friends with love and kindness, but when it comes to ourselves, we are our own harshest critic and berate ourselves. 
This app aims to be somewhat similar to cognitive behavioral therapy which focuses on challenging and changing unhelpful cognitive 
distortions and behaviors, improving emotional regulation, and the development of personal coping strategies that target solving current 
problems. 

This tbrough the stimulation of a messaging app that allows the user to pretend that they are talking to their friends, but in reality,
are talking to themselves.
